### Qliq API testsuite (aka webapp) ###
=====

I wrote this to confirm the behavior of our RESTful API.  This allows us to confirm the operation and performance of the API in isolation of it running on iPhone or Android.

You can see it running in production at [api.qliqup.com](https://api.qliqup.com/v1.2/qliqserver/static/webapp/html/index.html) or [test.qliqup.com](http://test.qliqup.com/future/static/site/webapp/html/index.html#)

It uses:

 - [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)
 - [amplify.js](http://amplifyjs.com/)
